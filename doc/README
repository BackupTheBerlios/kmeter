                             Installation
                             ============

Left to do.

To compile on 64-bit GNU/Linux operating systems, install the multilib
files for g++ (Debian package: "g++-multilib").  Then, change the
following lines in juce/build/linux/juce_premake.lua to match:

	package.config["Debug"].target   = "juce_debug32"
	package.config["Release"].target = "juce32"

	package.config["Debug"].buildoptions    = { "-D_DEBUG -ggdb -Wall -fPIC -m32" }

	package.config["Release"].buildoptions  = { "-fvisibility=hidden -fPIC -m32" }

and then run:

	./runpremake

Finally, run make.

I love to hear from people who use my applications.  So if you can
spare the time, have any suggestions or want to create a nice theme,
head over to my website http://www.mzuther.de/ and drop me an email!
